# DevOps Linux Learning



## Overview

This repository documents my progress learning Linux through practical challenges and hands-on exercises.  
It includes solutions and notes from the OverTheWire Bandit wargame, along with summaries of key Linux concepts and command-line tools.

The goal of this repository is to build strong foundational Linux skills that directly support DevOps, automation, networking, and system administration work.



## Why Linux Matters in DevOps

Linux is the execution environment where the majority of DevOps workloads actually run. Cloud compute instances, container runtimes, CI/CD runners, orchestration platforms, and networking services all operate on top of Linux systems.

It is responsible for core system behaviour including process scheduling, memory management, file systems, networking stacks, user permissions, and service lifecycle management. Every container, virtual machine, and cloud server ultimately relies on Linux kernel features to function correctly.

In real production environments, most failures surface first at the Linux layer before they appear in higher level tools. Networking issues, disk pressure, permission misconfigurations, process crashes, and resource exhaustion are all Linux level problems that DevOps engineers must be able to diagnose directly.

Understanding Linux properly is not about running basic commands. It is about understanding how the operating system manages resources, isolates workloads, enforces security boundaries, and executes workloads at scale.

This repository reflects that shift from surface level usage to real system level understanding.
