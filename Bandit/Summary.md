# 🐧 Linux Notes & Summary

## 📘 Overview
Personal Linux notes from completing **OverTheWire Bandit (Levels 0 to 20)**, focused on core shell usage, file handling, permissions, compression, and basic networking.

---

## ⚡ Summary
* Built a strong foundation in Linux navigation, permissions, compression, search, and networking basics.  
* Learned how to combine small, focused commands into powerful pipelines.  
* Gained confidence troubleshooting hidden files, encodings, and user privileges.

---

## 🧠 Key Lessons
* Everything in Linux is a file — devices, processes, and sockets.  
* The `find`, `grep`, `cat`, and `file` commands together can solve most inspection tasks.  
* Always read the manual (`man`) and chain tools with pipes (`|`) to discover more efficient solutions.

## 🧩 Core Commands Cheat Sheet

### 🗂️ Navigation & File Management
* `pwd`: print working directory  
* `ls -la`: list all files (including hidden)  
* `cd ..`: move up a directory  
* `cat`, `less`, `head`, `tail`: view file contents  

### 🔍 Searching & Filtering
* `grep "pattern" file`: find lines matching a pattern  
* `grep -n "pattern" file`: include line numbers  
* `sort file | uniq -u`: show unique lines only  
* `strings file`: extract printable text from binary files  

### 🧭 Finding Files
* `find /path -type f -name "filename"`: search by name  
* `find / -type f -size 1033c`: search by exact size  
* `find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 2>/dev/null`: filter by owner or group, hide errors  

### 📄 File Type & Inspection
* `file file_name`: detect file type  
* `xxd -r hexdump.txt > binary`: reverse hexdump to binary  

### 🗜️ Compression / Archives
* `gzip -d file.gz` or `gunzip file.gz`: decompress gzip  
* `bzip2 -d file.bz2`: decompress bzip2  
* `tar -xvf file.tar`: extract tar archives  

### 🔡 Text Transform & Encoding
* `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`: ROT13 encode or decode  
* `xxd -r`: convert hex to binary  

### 🌐 Networking & Remote Access
* `ssh -i keyfile user@host -p port`: SSH with a private key  
* `ssh user@host "command"`: run a command remotely  
* `telnet host port`: connect to a TCP port  
* `openssl s_client -quiet -connect host:port`: test SSL or TLS service  
* `nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost`: scan ports  

### 🔒 Permissions & Ownership
* `ls -l`: show permissions and ownership  
* `chmod 600 keyfile`: restrict private key file access  
* `chmod +x script.sh`: make file executable  
* `id`: show user and group IDs  
* Setuid binaries (`-rwsr-x---`) run with the owner's privileges  

### 🧰 Useful Shell Tricks
* `2>/dev/null`: suppress permission errors  
* `cmd1 | cmd2`: pipe one command’s output into another  
* `cmd && cmd2`: run the second only if the first succeeds  
* `history | grep <term>`: find a past command

## 🧩 Bandit Problem-Solving Pattern
1. `ls -la`: inspect everything in the directory  
2. `file`: identify file type (text, binary, archive)  
3. If hex, use `xxd -r`; if compressed, use `gzip`, `bzip2`, or `tar`  
4. Use `strings`, `grep`, or `sort | uniq` for readable content  
5. For remote levels, use `telnet`, `openssl`, or `ssh`  
6. Manage keys with `chmod 600`  
7. Use `find` with filters to locate specific file attributes
